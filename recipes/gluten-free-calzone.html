        <!--Description of Recipe-->
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>If you’ve never had one before, it’s sort of like a pizza pastry. Think lovely, light, crisp pizza dough on the outside, concealing the contents of an oozing, melty pizza in the middle. You just can’t beat it!</p>

        <!--Directions/Steps-->
        <h2>Directions/Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to a very hot temperature!</li>
            <li>Add all your ingredients into a bowl and mix together. I initially just do this with a spatula and then as it starts to come together I use my hands to ensure it’s all pushed into a big ball.</li>
            <li>Cut the dough into 2-4 pieces - it can make either 2 huge calzone, 3 medium calzone or 4 smaller sized ones. I usually split mine into 2.</li>
            <li>On a lightly floured surface use a rolling pin to roll out your first dough portion. I roll mine to 0.4cm. Try to do this in an oval shape. </li>
            <li>Sometimes I find it helps to fold over the dough to make sure both ends are the same shape. You can then trim of any excess at this point if not.</li>
            <li>Sort out your fillings. So for the tomato sauce, mix together your tomato puree (1 tsp), passata (200ml), herbs (1 tsp) , garlic oil (1 tsp), salt and pepper in a small bowl until it has a nice, thick consistency.</li>
            <li>Chop up your mozzarella into small pieces as well as any veg you’re using  I used a yellow bell pepper.</li>
            <li>Spoon on and spread a small portion of your sauce, followed by toppings and then cheese on half of your calzone. Make sure you leave a good amount of space around the edge (about 1.5cm) as you need to fold the other-side over and you don’t want filling to ooze out.</li>
            <li>Brush the edge of your dough lightly with a little water to help it stick together. I actually just dabbed this on using my fingers all around the edges.</li>
            <li>Fold over your empty side of dough to go over the top of your filled side.</li>
            <li>Now, you can pinch this together to fully seal the calzone so the filling doesn’t come out. Basically just fold over a little section at a time to create a crimped look.</li>
            <li>Transfer your calzone onto a baking sheet – make sure that you use parchment paper if it’s not non stick.</li>
            <li>Use a sharp knife to cut 3 slits into the calzone. This will allow any excess moisture to get out and stop it from wanting to explode!</li>
            <li>Beat your egg in a separate bowl, then brush your gluten free calzone with the egg wash (or milk, melted butter, oil etc) all over the top. This will help to give it a lovely golden colour.</li>
            <li>Finish by sprinkling with a little pecorino cheese or parmesan.</li>
            <li>Place in the oven for 10 minutes until golden and crisp.</li>
        </ol>
